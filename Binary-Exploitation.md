# Binary Exploitation 
### Finding Correct LIBC Version
Often times, binary exploitation challenges do not include the `LIBC` library which is used by the `ELF` file. This can be pretty annoying, because the `LIBC` libraries are home to a lot of useful functions, such as `system` and `exec`. They are also home to a lot of ROP gadgets, which can be useful for building exploits. 

Since the address of the functions in `LIBC` can change depending on the `LIBC` version, it is important to find out the correct `LIBC` library used by the `ELF` file. If we have a leak of any function in `LIBC` (such as `__libc_start_main`), we can narrow down the `LIBC` version used by the `ELF` file with the help of following websites: 

 - [libc.rip](https://libc.rip/)
 - [libc.blukat.me](https://libc.blukat.me/)

To use either of the above websites, simply put the name of the function whose address you've leaked, and the corresponding leaked address. Note that you can directly enter the complete leaked address (such as `0x7ffff7e18240`) and the websites will try to figure out the correct `LIBC` libraries used. 

**Caveats:** It might happen that the function name you enter might be slightly off than what the website expects. For example, it might happen that putting the function name as `__funlockfile` might not yield any result, but putting the function name as `funlockfile` might yield results. So, its best to experiment with the function names before making any conclusion about the results.
